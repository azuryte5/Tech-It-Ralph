## Usage
This application is for the digital characters of Wreck-it Ralph. Mainly due to the word play with "Tech-it Ralph. 

Here we have a tech blog about the goings on with our favourite characters on a post/comment type forum.

Existing users can login in with their credentials and add posts, edit and delete their old posts. Users can also comment on their own or other posts.

New users can sign up with a user name and password. 

This application demonstrates an understanding of a MVC approach. 

First image shows an example of the most recent posts. The current signed in user and where they can log out or comment on other posts.

The 2nd image shows the code particularly the handlebars and server code.
